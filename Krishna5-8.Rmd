#in this file I hope to do a simple permutation test on some made up data just 
# to hopefully work through the mechanics of it. 

#louad the libreary "data.table" so that I will be able to create a data table
library("data.table") 
```

```{r}
# create a data table using some noncese data.
# this data frame has to collomes and two rows representing two groups and 
# two results, repsectivly. We can think of the two groups as treatment and 
# control and the two results as success and failure.
dataTest= data.frame(c(57, 33), c(101, 90))

# add row and colomn names to dataTest. Even though it isn't based on 
# anthing I am naming the columns treatment and control and the 
# rows sucess and failure to that it will hopfully make it easer to think 
# through what I am doing. 
colnames(dataTest) = c('treatment', 'control')
rownames(dataTest) <- c("Success", "Failure")

#call dataTest to make sure everything worked. 
dataTest

sum(dataTest[2])
```
```{r}
#Now for the actual permutation test. 

#Notice that Treatment~Binom(#of treatments, pi1)
# and Control~Binom(# of controls, pi2)

#Ho: pi1=pi2, we will estimate pi1=pi2=success/total

#Ha: pi1 != pi2

#Permuting the data should essentially mean generating a random number of success
# Under the null hypotheses, 
# we can use rbinom to generate random responses 

permTest <- function(x, n){
  
  p<- sum(x[1,])/sum(x) #Proportion of successes
  
  treatmentPermData <- rbinom(n, sum(x[1]), p) #n = # of permutations
  controlPermData <- rbinom(n, sum(x[2]), p)
  
  #Now we need to use each of the permutations to create an estimate of 
  # the proportion of successes for the treatment and control
  #I'm not sure if this is how I should do it, but I am just going to
  # divide the number of successes by the total number of subjects
  # for each group, and have that be my estimated proportion. 
  treatmentPermProps<-treatmentPermData / sum(x[1])
  controlPermProps<-controlPermData / sum(x[2])
  
  # now to get our sample of test statistics (or our null distribution)
  # we will want to take the differince of the estimated proportion of 
  # successes for the treatment group minus the estimated proportion of 
  # successes for the control group for each of our permutations 
  TestStatistics <- treatmentPermProps-controlPermProps
  
  #Now we will find the test statistic for our actual data. 
  t <- (sum(x[1,1])/sum(x[1])) - (sum(x[1,2])/sum(x[2]))

#For loop checks how our calculated p-values compare to the test statistic - counts up the number of values that exceed it, are less than its negative, or are equivalent to it
  for (i in 1:length(TestStatistics)) {
    if(TestStatistics[i] > t || TestStatistics[i]<minus_t || TestStatistics[i]== t || TestStatistics[i]== minus_t) {

    }
  }
  return(count/n) #Prints our count that meet the above criteria
}

#Runs the function defined above q times.
